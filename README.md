# Operating-System-Foundations--Project-4
Implementation of thread manager, process manager, frame manager

In this project, we will implement three monitors that will be used in our Kernel. These are the ThreadManager, the ProcessManager, and the FrameManager. There is also an task—re-implementing the Condition and Mutex classes to provide Hoare Semantics—but this code will not be used in the Kernel.

Code written in: Main.c Main.h Kernel.h Kernel.c
